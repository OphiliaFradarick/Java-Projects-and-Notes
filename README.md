When you override a parent class method in a child class, you can insert an oveeride annotation just prior to the method. 
The @Override annotation lets the compiler know that your intention is to override a method in the parent class rather than create a method with a new signature.

Polymorphism

Using the same method name to indicate different implemenatation is called polymorphism - A term meaning many forms
many different forms of action take place, eventhiugh you see the same word to describe the action.
If a programming language does not support polymorphism, the language is not considered as object oriented. 
It is important to note that each subclass method overrides any method in the parent class that has both the same name and parameter list.
If the parent class method has the same name but different parameter list, the subclass method does not iverride the parent class. Instead the suclass method overloads the parent class method and any subclass object has access too both versions.
